1
00:00:37,241 --> 00:00:39,361
Edgar!

2
00:00:42,761 --> 00:00:44,441
What did he die of?

3
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:49,481
The same thing
our Church is going to die of.

4
00:00:51,081 --> 00:00:52,281
Old age.

5
00:01:28,841 --> 00:01:32,921
<i>...et apostolicae fidei cultoribus.</i>

6
00:01:44,281 --> 00:01:47,481
What is it about that statuette
that you find so sensual?

7
00:01:49,841 --> 00:01:53,121
I'd prefer not to delve into my psyche.

8
00:01:53,841 --> 00:01:56,881
Holy Father, donations have declined.

9
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:58,841
Revenues from religious taxes

10
00:01:59,001 --> 00:02:03,761
which our bishops and dioceses
depend on for their survival

11
00:02:03,921 --> 00:02:05,481
have declined.

12
00:02:05,641 --> 00:02:09,041
Tourist visits
to the Vatican have declined

13
00:02:09,201 --> 00:02:13,081
greatly reducing the influx
of funds to Vatican City.

14
00:02:13,241 --> 00:02:16,081
There is not much
that the Vatican Bank can do.

15
00:02:16,241 --> 00:02:19,841
Our days of free willing
finances are over.

16
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:24,521
Changes in banking regulations
mean that our hands are now tied.

17
00:02:24,681 --> 00:02:27,041
If we continue on this course

18
00:02:27,201 --> 00:02:31,081
we'll be forced to start selling
off our artistic patrimony

19
00:02:31,241 --> 00:02:33,241
simply to survive.

20
00:02:33,841 --> 00:02:35,921
The faithful will return.

21
00:02:36,081 --> 00:02:37,481
It's a natural cycle.

22
00:02:37,641 --> 00:02:40,041
For now, the faithful
are not returning.

23
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:45,081
And small but dangerous enclaves
of Catholic fundamentalism

24
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:48,481
are starting to spring up,
just like in Islam.

25
00:02:49,841 --> 00:02:53,241
Islam has more followers
than the Catholic Church.

26
00:02:57,121 --> 00:03:00,401
Don't you find it a burden
to take on the responsibility

27
00:03:00,561 --> 00:03:03,401
of such risky
and unpopular decisions?

28
00:03:05,401 --> 00:03:06,601
No.

29
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:10,201
Your Holiness, who are you, really?

30
00:08:05,161 --> 00:08:08,241
Pushing. Pushing, OK.

31
00:08:08,401 --> 00:08:10,281
OK, Esther.

32
00:08:11,001 --> 00:08:12,801
OK, Esther.

33
00:08:12,961 --> 00:08:14,521
Push more.

34
00:08:14,681 --> 00:08:18,081
Push.
Very good, Very good.

35
00:08:18,241 --> 00:08:22,161
OK, Esther, OK, OK, OK.

36
00:08:22,321 --> 00:08:25,641
Keep pushing, keep pushing now.

37
00:08:26,201 --> 00:08:27,601
OK.

38
00:08:29,361 --> 00:08:31,761
OK, OK.

This is for the baby.

56
00:16:51,241 --> 00:16:52,801
You shouldn't have, Holy Father.

57
00:16:52,961 --> 00:16:56,121
It's a Bible that belonged to
Thomas Jefferson

58
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:58,561
the President of the United States

59
00:16:58,721 --> 00:17:01,801
but it's like new,
he never opened it.

60
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:07,281
We certainly can't blame Jefferson,
the Bible isn't light reading.

61
00:17:19,321 --> 00:17:20,921
We named him Pius.

62
00:17:23,601 --> 00:17:25,361
A name for a bird.

63
00:17:26,081 --> 00:17:27,121
He'll fly high!

64
00:17:27,281 --> 00:17:29,881
Do you want to hold him,
Your Holiness?

65
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:32,881
That really would be
an unusual experience for me.

66
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:36,321
And for Peter and I
it would be an honor.

67
00:18:04,241 --> 00:18:08,001
Pleasure to make your acquaintance,
Mr. Pius XIV.

68
00:18:22,841 --> 00:18:26,481
It's a pity we can't remember
what we smelled like

69
00:18:26,521 --> 00:18:27,881
when we were babies.

70
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:38,361
I do remember
what my parents smelled like.

71
00:18:44,521 --> 00:18:45,841
He takes after you.

72
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:47,561
But if you look closely,
he also takes a little...

73
00:18:47,721 --> 00:18:49,161
No.
He's a very good-looking baby.

74
00:18:49,321 --> 00:18:50,921
He resembles his mother.

75
00:18:54,321 --> 00:18:55,241
Holy Father.

76
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:01,081
Forgive me. I'm such a fool.

77
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:03,761
My hands only know
how to bless people.

78
00:19:03,801 --> 00:19:05,521
It's all right Holy Father,
nothing happened.

79
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,601
I'm such an idiot.

80
00:19:06,681 --> 00:19:08,761
We all have to get used
to new things, Holy Father.

81
00:19:08,801 --> 00:19:09,801
Nothing happened.

82
00:19:09,841 --> 00:19:11,001
Yes, yes you're right, Peter.

83
00:19:11,081 --> 00:19:13,721
Valente, was there something you
wanted to tell me?

84
00:19:13,761 --> 00:19:17,321
Holy Father, the Italian Prime Minister
is waiting for you in the Vatican.

85
00:19:18,361 --> 00:19:21,441
Yes, of course,
it had slipped my mind.

86
00:19:32,001 --> 00:19:35,401
Esther, I must go.

87
00:19:35,561 --> 00:19:37,681
In my head,
I'll be at this audience

88
00:19:37,721 --> 00:19:40,521
but in my heart
I'll never have left this room.

89
00:19:45,241 --> 00:19:48,321
It's surprising to see
how a young woman

90
00:19:48,481 --> 00:19:52,681
just moments after having a child,
can be transformed into a mother.

91
00:21:31,841 --> 00:21:33,681
Are you asleep, Holy Father?

92
00:21:34,921 --> 00:21:38,521
No, Mr. Prime Minister.
I'm praying for you

93
00:21:38,681 --> 00:21:41,121
That's very thoughtful of you.

94
00:21:41,281 --> 00:21:43,361
And thanks very much
for giving me this audience

95
00:21:43,521 --> 00:21:45,441
after just nine months.

96
00:21:47,841 --> 00:21:50,081
I didn't think you'd be running
the Country this long.

97
00:21:51,121 --> 00:21:53,921
I said to myself: why bother?

98
00:21:54,921 --> 00:21:55,961
But I was wrong.

99
00:21:58,081 --> 00:21:59,081
Well...

100
00:22:00,161 --> 00:22:03,441
how is this Italy of ours doing?

101
00:22:04,601 --> 00:22:06,721
Much better, thanks to me.

102
00:22:06,881 --> 00:22:07,881
You think so?
- Yes.

103
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:09,761
I think just the opposite.

104
00:22:10,961 --> 00:22:13,481
You want it to do "much better"

105
00:22:13,641 --> 00:22:18,281
perhaps you should keep firmly
in mind this list of requests.

106
00:22:20,121 --> 00:22:23,361
I jotted it down in a hurry
just a few minutes ago.

107
00:22:23,521 --> 00:22:27,281
If there's anything I've left off,
I can certainly add it to the list.

108
00:22:27,441 --> 00:22:29,521
I'll make sure you receive
it promptly.

109
00:22:30,481 --> 00:22:32,681
" Greater assistance
to Catholic families

110
00:22:34,161 --> 00:22:36,001
no to common law marriages.

111
00:22:36,161 --> 00:22:37,121
Mmm.

112
00:22:38,321 --> 00:22:39,881
No to gay marriages
- Mmm.

113
00:22:40,681 --> 00:22:43,161
more money to Catholic schools

114
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:46,401
further tax and banking benefits
to the Holy See.

115
00:22:47,761 --> 00:22:51,041
Absolute prohibition
of abortion in all cases.

116
00:22:51,201 --> 00:22:54,801
Absolute prohibition
of divorce in all cases.

117
00:22:54,961 --> 00:22:57,641
No to any temptation
to accept euthanasia

118
00:22:57,801 --> 00:23:00,881
restrictions
on the religious freedom

119
00:23:01,041 --> 00:23:03,081
of Muslims and Hindus.

120
00:23:03,241 --> 00:23:04,081
Mmm.

121
00:23:05,481 --> 00:23:09,441
A reopening of discussions
on the Lateran Pacts.

122
00:23:09,601 --> 00:23:13,841
A full review of the territorial
boundaries of the Vatican State."

123
00:23:17,081 --> 00:23:19,921
This last request really is
remarkable, I have to admit.

124
00:23:20,081 --> 00:23:23,521
I didn't know that you had
expansionistic ambitions.

125
00:23:26,681 --> 00:23:29,681
But I was told before coming that
this new Pope is a very funny man.

126
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:31,841
But did they forget to inform you
that this new Pope

127
00:23:31,881 --> 00:23:33,801
was a man far more
intelligent than you?

128
00:23:34,321 --> 00:23:36,841
No. Because it isn't true.

129
00:23:39,561 --> 00:23:42,561
Do you know what the difference is
between me and you, Holy Father?

130
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:44,281
Let's hear.

131
00:23:44,441 --> 00:23:49,441
The difference is that I was
elected with 41% of the votes.

132
00:23:49,601 --> 00:23:51,681
That 41% exists.

133
00:23:52,521 --> 00:23:54,761
You were elected by God.

134
00:23:54,921 --> 00:23:57,161
And it's not a sure thing
that God exists.

135
00:23:59,841 --> 00:24:01,201
Fine!

136
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:05,001
There's another element worthy
of your consideration:

137
00:24:05,961 --> 00:24:09,481
just in case God
does happen to exist

138
00:24:09,641 --> 00:24:11,801
do you know how long
it would take Him to wipe

139
00:24:11,961 --> 00:24:15,281
that 41% off the face of the earth?

140
00:24:18,441 --> 00:24:21,361
And where will God eradicate
that 41%?

141
00:24:21,521 --> 00:24:24,121
At the polls in the next election?

142
00:24:24,281 --> 00:24:27,161
Or in their homes
while they're watching TV?

143
00:24:27,321 --> 00:24:29,081
Or perhaps in their sleep!

144
00:24:31,281 --> 00:24:33,641
At the polls in the next election.

145
00:24:36,001 --> 00:24:39,801
And what's more:
I, as the vicar of Christ

146
00:24:39,961 --> 00:24:44,361
would be happy to help God
eradicate that 41%.

147
00:24:47,001 --> 00:24:49,921
And if you don't stop playing the idiot

148
00:24:51,361 --> 00:24:55,481
I'm gonna be forced to prove to you
that God does exist.

149
00:24:59,201 --> 00:25:02,361
Let me explain something to you, Holy Father.
- Please.

150
00:25:02,521 --> 00:25:05,081
Your demands might have
some basis in fact

151
00:25:05,121 --> 00:25:07,121
at any other point in history.

152
00:25:07,281 --> 00:25:10,441
At a point in history
when the Church was stronger

153
00:25:10,601 --> 00:25:12,121
than it is right now

154
00:25:12,281 --> 00:25:15,241
the Italian political equation
would have been obliged

155
00:25:15,401 --> 00:25:18,681
to take your demands
under serious consideration.

156
00:25:18,721 --> 00:25:20,041
The way it always has in the past.

157
00:25:20,961 --> 00:25:22,281
But now

158
00:25:22,441 --> 00:25:26,281
let us briefly analyze
your Papacy, Holy Father.

159
00:25:27,721 --> 00:25:31,641
In the past nine months you have
never shown yourself

160
00:25:31,681 --> 00:25:32,721
to the faithful.

161
00:25:33,441 --> 00:25:37,401
You have not recited a single
Angelus in St. Peter's Square

162
00:25:37,561 --> 00:25:39,521
you have not communicated
with anyone

163
00:25:39,681 --> 00:25:42,881
you have simply retreated
into your palace on the hill

164
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:46,161
and you have threatened
and terrorized the faithful

165
00:25:46,321 --> 00:25:48,641
through your terse
and telegraphic <i>communiqués</i>

166
00:25:48,801 --> 00:25:53,041
in <i>L'Osservatore Vaticano</i>, with
obscurantist and retrograde theses.

167
00:25:54,041 --> 00:25:55,521
The result has been that

168
00:25:56,161 --> 00:25:59,721
according to a number
of highly respected studies

169
00:25:59,881 --> 00:26:04,321
Italian Catholics have turned away
from the Church en masse.

170
00:26:05,961 --> 00:26:11,441
This new development not only
allows me to ignore your requests

171
00:26:12,641 --> 00:26:15,481
but it gives me
an even greater opportunity:

172
00:26:15,641 --> 00:26:18,001
finally to modernize Italy.

173
00:26:18,161 --> 00:26:22,761
Without fear of retaliation or the risk
of losing support among voters

174
00:26:22,801 --> 00:26:25,961
I can review the colossal fraud

175
00:26:26,121 --> 00:26:27,801
of the eight per thousand
Church tax

176
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:32,281
finally imposing punitive
taxes on the dioceses.

177
00:26:33,081 --> 00:26:34,961
And, most important of all

178
00:26:35,121 --> 00:26:37,921
I can finally free the country
from the pork barrels

179
00:26:38,081 --> 00:26:41,241
stumbling blocks, and vetoes
of the Holy Roman Church

180
00:26:41,401 --> 00:26:44,681
in the areas of euthanasia,
common law marriages

181
00:26:44,841 --> 00:26:48,401
gay couples, abortion,
scientific research.

182
00:26:48,561 --> 00:26:51,401
To cut a long story short,
Holy Father

183
00:26:51,561 --> 00:26:54,161
thanks to you
I can start a revolution.

184
00:26:58,601 --> 00:27:00,241
A very persuasive speech.

185
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:04,881
I'm glad we're finally beginning
to talk sense.

186
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:07,521
Persuasive and stupid

187
00:27:08,201 --> 00:27:10,441
I might add, like every
politicians' speech.

188
00:27:10,601 --> 00:27:14,801
And what's more, unrealizable.

189
00:27:15,841 --> 00:27:18,081
Unrealizable?
- Hmm.

190
00:27:18,241 --> 00:27:19,961
We shall see about that!

191
00:27:20,121 --> 00:27:22,961
Now, if you'd care to listen to me

192
00:27:23,121 --> 00:27:24,601
I'll show you that God exists

193
00:27:24,761 --> 00:27:30,121
and how God and I can annihilate
that 41% of the population

194
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:34,081
that makes you feel so cheerful
and full of yourself.

195
00:27:35,201 --> 00:27:38,161
I am very eager to hear what you
have to say, Holy Father.

196
00:27:38,321 --> 00:27:39,481
I'm glad.

197
00:27:40,481 --> 00:27:43,121
You see, Mr. Prime Minister

198
00:27:43,281 --> 00:27:48,281
in the Sixties the young people
that protested in the streets

199
00:27:48,441 --> 00:27:50,921
spouted all kind of heresies

200
00:27:51,081 --> 00:27:52,361
all except one:

201
00:27:53,281 --> 00:27:55,641
power to the imagination.

202
00:27:56,401 --> 00:27:59,361
In that, they were correct.

203
00:27:59,521 --> 00:28:02,561
The only problem was they had
no imagination.

204
00:28:04,161 --> 00:28:06,081
And neither do you.

205
00:28:06,921 --> 00:28:09,201
But God and I have plenty.

206
00:28:09,361 --> 00:28:14,121
God and I are simply dripping
with imagination.

207
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:20,681
Now, just try and imagine
something with me:

208
00:28:21,401 --> 00:28:22,761
Hmm?
- Hmm.

209
00:28:23,081 --> 00:28:27,081
in six months, Italy will hold
the general election

210
00:28:27,241 --> 00:28:30,441
and you will try to maintain
or increase

211
00:28:30,601 --> 00:28:33,241
your 41% share of the electorate.

212
00:28:34,081 --> 00:28:36,321
And right now everything indeed

213
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:39,961
points to your ability
to maintain that 41%.

214
00:28:40,121 --> 00:28:40,961
Yeah.

215
00:28:41,121 --> 00:28:42,161
But just imagine

216
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:46,161
a few weeks before the election,
there comes an announcement.

217
00:28:46,321 --> 00:28:51,201
Pope Pius XIII has decided
to appear in public

218
00:28:52,001 --> 00:28:53,641
for the very first time.

219
00:28:54,921 --> 00:28:57,521
To talk to the Italian Catholics.

220
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:02,041
What morbid curiosity!

221
00:29:02,201 --> 00:29:06,441
The whole world
is dying of curiosity.

222
00:29:06,961 --> 00:29:09,521
And it is absolutely
to be expected

223
00:29:09,681 --> 00:29:13,681
it's normal, we all want to see
that which is hidden

224
00:29:14,761 --> 00:29:17,681
we all want to stare
the forbidden in the face.

225
00:29:19,161 --> 00:29:24,641
Pius XIII appears and so
do his beautiful blue-eyes...

226
00:29:25,801 --> 00:29:28,281
and this soft, round mouth.

227
00:29:28,921 --> 00:29:30,601
A dazzling image

228
00:29:30,761 --> 00:29:33,561
so dazzling it blinds people.

229
00:29:34,281 --> 00:29:37,801
In other words, a powerful,
an evocative image

230
00:29:38,241 --> 00:29:40,161
not unlike that of Christ.

231
00:29:40,961 --> 00:29:43,081
But Pius XIII
doesn't merely dazzle

232
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:45,841
he offers reassurance as well.

233
00:29:46,281 --> 00:29:50,081
With a magnificent speech,
full of quotations in Latin

234
00:29:51,921 --> 00:29:57,481
it tells them that they,
the faithful, must not be afraid.

235
00:29:59,281 --> 00:30:02,441
And why would they be afraid,
with a Pope as handsome

236
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:04,921
and reassuring as Christ?

237
00:30:06,521 --> 00:30:09,921
Last of all, just a few short
weeks before the elections

238
00:30:10,521 --> 00:30:14,041
the Pope says just two words:

239
00:30:15,521 --> 00:30:17,641
<i>"non expedit".</i>

240
00:30:22,721 --> 00:30:24,521
Do you know what that means?
- No.

241
00:30:24,681 --> 00:30:27,121
No, of course you don't.
You're far too young.

242
00:30:27,281 --> 00:30:32,521
The <i>"non expedit"</i> was first issued
by Pius IX in 1868.

243
00:30:32,681 --> 00:30:36,721
It was eliminated by Benedict XV
in 1919

244
00:30:37,441 --> 00:30:40,041
but guess what I can do?

245
00:30:42,641 --> 00:30:47,681
What I, who am not answerable
to 41% of the Italians

246
00:30:47,841 --> 00:30:51,921
but only to God who, by the way,
does not express His displeasure

247
00:30:52,081 --> 00:30:54,321
on social network
if I make a mistake.

248
00:30:55,561 --> 00:30:57,641
Guess what I can do?

249
00:30:58,281 --> 00:31:01,401
I can restore the <i>"non expedit".</i>

250
00:31:03,081 --> 00:31:06,401
The Catholics will all rush
to Google those words.

251
00:31:07,961 --> 00:31:10,081
What do they mean?

252
00:31:11,401 --> 00:31:16,801
The "<i>non expedit</i>" means
that the Holy Father

253
00:31:17,681 --> 00:31:22,441
decrees it is unacceptable
for Catholics

254
00:31:22,601 --> 00:31:25,841
to vote in the Italian elections.

255
00:31:29,841 --> 00:31:34,921
And do you know what the surveys
that you have commissioned tell us?

256
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:38,961
They tell us that the number
of Italians who identify themselves

257
00:31:39,121 --> 00:31:44,041
as Catholics are 87.8%
of the population.

258
00:31:46,281 --> 00:31:48,321
Now you may say to me:

259
00:31:48,481 --> 00:31:50,961
they could simply disobey you.

260
00:31:51,121 --> 00:31:52,881
True.

261
00:31:53,041 --> 00:31:57,801
But while a Catholic
might disobey the Pope

262
00:31:59,641 --> 00:32:01,641
they'd never disobey Christ.

263
00:32:02,641 --> 00:32:04,921
I'm already the former

264
00:32:05,081 --> 00:32:07,761
but believe me, if I want to

265
00:32:07,921 --> 00:32:11,521
I can have myself accredited
as the latter as well

266
00:32:12,721 --> 00:32:16,361
and when I do,
you'll lose your election.

267
00:32:17,641 --> 00:32:19,281
Here's how it works:

268
00:32:19,441 --> 00:32:23,041
since you get 31% of your votes
from the Catholic electorate

269
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:29,441
you'd wind up with
a mere 10%.

270
00:32:32,401 --> 00:32:35,041
I wouldn't be so sure
of those numbers, if I were you.

271
00:32:52,481 --> 00:32:53,881
Mr. Prime Minister

272
00:33:00,001 --> 00:33:01,401
take a look in this mirror.

273
00:33:04,201 --> 00:33:05,761
What do you see?

274
00:33:07,601 --> 00:33:09,001
Two young men.

275
00:33:09,881 --> 00:33:12,601
One of whom is dressed
in a slightly odd style.

276
00:33:12,761 --> 00:33:16,921
I, on the other hand,
see two media events.

277
00:33:18,881 --> 00:33:22,561
One has already taken place,
that's you.

278
00:33:26,881 --> 00:33:28,801
The other is about to happen.

279
00:33:33,961 --> 00:33:36,921
Now, having set out

280
00:33:37,321 --> 00:33:40,161
to prove to you
the existence of God

281
00:33:41,601 --> 00:33:42,761
I believe I'm done.

282
00:34:00,241 --> 00:34:02,761
But in that case, why...

283
00:34:02,921 --> 00:34:04,961
why haven't you appeared
in public yet?

284
00:34:09,161 --> 00:34:10,441
Because...

285
00:34:12,121 --> 00:34:13,561
there's still no need.

286
00:35:00,521 --> 00:35:03,601
Holy Father, would you like me
to see what I can do

287
00:35:03,761 --> 00:35:06,921
to mend the relations
with the Italian Government?

288
00:35:07,081 --> 00:35:09,161
- He's bluffing.
- Who?

289
00:35:09,321 --> 00:35:12,121
The young man in a hurry
speaking on TV right now.

290
00:35:12,281 --> 00:35:14,401
He's selling smoke and mirrors.

291
00:35:14,561 --> 00:35:16,321
He won't do a thing he says.

292
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:19,481
Holy Father,
I've read the draft bills

293
00:35:19,521 --> 00:35:23,801
that have already been approved
by the various commissions.

294
00:35:23,961 --> 00:35:26,001
These people are deadly serious.

295
00:35:26,761 --> 00:35:29,521
The revision of the eight
per thousand Church tax

296
00:35:29,681 --> 00:35:33,041
would threaten the survival
of the Italian bishops.

297
00:35:34,521 --> 00:35:36,601
Would that be such a bad thing?

298
00:35:36,761 --> 00:35:39,521
What do we care?
You and I are the Holy See.

299
00:35:41,481 --> 00:35:44,041
The Italian bishops
can take care of themselves.

300
00:35:44,201 --> 00:35:47,561
Holy Father, I beg you,
this is no laughing matter.

301
00:35:47,721 --> 00:35:49,561
Rest easy, he's bluffing.

302
00:35:49,721 --> 00:35:52,641
Holy Father, believe me,
political awareness

303
00:35:52,801 --> 00:35:56,801
is an archetypal emotion
for the Secretary of State.

304
00:35:57,881 --> 00:36:03,001
Soccer mania is an archetypal
emotion for the Secretary of State.

305
00:36:04,801 --> 00:36:09,081
I want to let you know that I've
been working hard on something new.

306
00:36:12,441 --> 00:36:13,681
On what?

307
00:36:14,321 --> 00:36:16,641
A measure forbidding priests
from giving absolution

308
00:36:16,801 --> 00:36:19,521
in the confessional
to women who have had abortions.

309
00:36:19,681 --> 00:36:24,881
Its a kind of soft,
disguised form of excommunication.

310
00:36:25,041 --> 00:36:29,481
Holy Father, we will wake up
and find the women of the world

311
00:36:29,641 --> 00:36:32,961
led by the Femen,
rushing the walls of the Vatican

312
00:36:33,121 --> 00:36:35,401
hammers in hand,
bent on destruction.

313
00:36:35,561 --> 00:36:41,321
Fine. We'll rebuild those walls,
taller and finer.

314
00:36:45,681 --> 00:36:49,601
Old and unreliable Rorschach tests.

315
00:36:49,761 --> 00:36:55,001
Orders to investigate intrusively
into the past of aspiring priests.

316
00:36:55,161 --> 00:36:59,081
Young men paid bounties
to lure those aspiring priests

317
00:36:59,241 --> 00:37:01,881
into compromising sexual situations

318
00:37:02,041 --> 00:37:04,961
as soon as they're allowed
out into the world.

319
00:37:05,121 --> 00:37:08,481
That's what I read in the directive
I found on my desk this morning

320
00:37:08,641 --> 00:37:12,961
drawn up by who knows what renegade
underling while I was in Honduras.

321
00:37:14,041 --> 00:37:15,641
Drawn up by me!

322
00:37:19,641 --> 00:37:22,561
Every candidate for priesthood
takes a vow of chastity.

323
00:37:22,721 --> 00:37:24,801
Their sexual predilections
are irrelevant.

324
00:37:24,961 --> 00:37:26,641
Every candidate for priesthood

325
00:37:26,801 --> 00:37:29,921
takes a vow of chastity
and none of them respect it.

326
00:37:30,001 --> 00:37:31,441
That's the truth.

327
00:37:32,361 --> 00:37:35,241
Well, I'm telling you no.

328
00:37:35,881 --> 00:37:37,881
Lenny, I'm not okay with this.

329
00:37:42,281 --> 00:37:43,641
I didn't go looking for my parents.

330
00:37:43,801 --> 00:37:46,001
Instead, I went back to the orphanage,

331
00:37:46,161 --> 00:37:48,721
in order to be with my friend
Andrew Dussolier

332
00:37:48,881 --> 00:37:52,081
who was all I had left
in the world.

333
00:37:53,601 --> 00:37:55,441
That was the beginning.

334
00:37:59,201 --> 00:38:03,481
You owe me, as a friend,
and as a man of the cloth

335
00:38:03,641 --> 00:38:08,121
who acknowledges my authority,
you must do what I ask.

336
00:38:54,161 --> 00:38:56,281
♪ Do you know

337
00:38:56,761 --> 00:39:00,681
♪ How sad it is to be a man alone

338
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:04,401
♪ I feel so

339
00:39:05,961 --> 00:39:09,521
♪ solitary being in my home

340
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:11,401
♪ Without you

341
00:39:12,041 --> 00:39:14,561
♪ I don't know what to do

342
00:39:14,601 --> 00:39:18,041
♪ And I don't know where you are

343
00:39:20,961 --> 00:39:23,121
♪ I can see

344
00:39:24,241 --> 00:39:26,521
♪ My life is meant to
fall apart some day

345
00:39:27,761 --> 00:39:30,201
♪ I got no girl

346
00:39:30,241 --> 00:39:32,441
♪ So I got no world

347
00:39:32,481 --> 00:39:36,281
♪ And I got no words left to say ♪

348
00:40:10,001 --> 00:40:12,521
Here you are: Sanchez Angelo.

349
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:18,161
My superiors have determined
that you are neither suited for

350
00:40:18,321 --> 00:40:21,321
nor worthy of the priesthood.

351
00:40:21,481 --> 00:40:24,681
You are prohibited from requesting
admission to a seminary

352
00:40:24,841 --> 00:40:29,041
in your home diocese
or in any other, for seven years.

353
00:40:31,441 --> 00:40:32,961
Why?

354
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:38,561
Put in simpler terms,
the sexual disturbances afflicting you

355
00:40:39,281 --> 00:40:42,681
are unacceptable
in terms of our standards.

356
00:41:17,481 --> 00:41:18,801
What do you want?

357
00:41:20,721 --> 00:41:21,961
Your resignation.

358
00:41:24,201 --> 00:41:25,601
Otherwise...

359
00:41:27,721 --> 00:41:29,921
our order will threaten a schism.

360
00:41:43,281 --> 00:41:44,921
A schism?

361
00:41:46,281 --> 00:41:48,161
Just try it.

362
00:41:50,681 --> 00:41:53,281
I'll strip you of all you have.

363
00:41:54,401 --> 00:41:55,441
Everything.

364
00:41:55,601 --> 00:41:59,641
Your beds, your tunics,
your underpants

365
00:41:59,801 --> 00:42:04,041
all those wonderful monasteries
you have in the most wonderful

366
00:42:04,201 --> 00:42:05,841
loveliest places on earth.

367
00:42:06,001 --> 00:42:09,361
Because all that belongs to me.

368
00:42:10,721 --> 00:42:15,001
Are you ready to live on the streets?
Like St. Francis of Assisi?

369
00:42:15,161 --> 00:42:17,081
Are you ready to sleep
on the ground

370
00:42:17,241 --> 00:42:22,281
kicked and spat upon by junkies,
and homeless people, and drunks?

371
00:42:22,441 --> 00:42:26,561
I'm ready to wage a war
without end against you.

372
00:42:26,721 --> 00:42:28,841
Are you ready to wage that war

373
00:42:29,001 --> 00:42:31,881
armed with nothing
but bottomless poverty?

374
00:42:41,641 --> 00:42:43,641
I didn't think so.

375
00:42:43,801 --> 00:42:46,881
And in that case,
stop talking bullshit

376
00:42:47,041 --> 00:42:48,681
and get yourselves some shoes

377
00:42:48,841 --> 00:42:51,561
because the air
in here is unbreathable.

378
00:47:57,521 --> 00:47:59,601
Cardinal Dussolier

379
00:48:00,641 --> 00:48:03,401
I know you,
but you don't know me.

380
00:48:03,801 --> 00:48:07,641
I'm Contessa Emma Meraviglia,
the wife of General Meraviglia.

381
00:48:09,801 --> 00:48:13,441
You know, I don't like seeing you
all on your own.

382
00:48:14,801 --> 00:48:16,521
I'm accustomed to it, signora.

383
00:48:16,681 --> 00:48:18,921
That's a bad custom to get into.

384
00:48:19,081 --> 00:48:22,521
My girlfriends would compete
to keep you company.

385
00:48:22,681 --> 00:48:24,121
And so would I.

386
00:48:24,281 --> 00:48:27,241
In any case, my husband and I
will be hosting a party

387
00:48:27,401 --> 00:48:29,321
Thursday at our villa.

388
00:48:29,481 --> 00:48:32,881
If you're at loose ends,
please come.

389
00:48:33,521 --> 00:48:36,361
It would be an honor
for my husband and me.

390
00:48:37,801 --> 00:48:40,441
OK, thank you.
I'll keep it in mind.

391
00:48:40,601 --> 00:48:41,641
Bye.

392
00:49:00,481 --> 00:49:02,441
My name is Angelo Sanchez.

393
00:49:04,001 --> 00:49:07,801
I was born in Alicante
into a family of manual laborers

394
00:49:09,241 --> 00:49:11,001
and I am not a homosexual.

395
00:49:11,841 --> 00:49:14,841
I had such a simple dream:
to serve God.

396
00:49:17,161 --> 00:49:19,001
You murdered my dream.

397
00:49:21,401 --> 00:49:23,481
You are nothing more
than a pathetic

398
00:49:24,201 --> 00:49:26,281
miserable, cowardly murderer.

399
00:50:22,361 --> 00:50:25,961
I could have been
an excellent priest.

400
00:50:28,281 --> 00:50:29,921
Yeah, you could have.

401
00:50:48,241 --> 00:50:50,121
I want to go home.

402
00:50:59,881 --> 00:51:01,401
What do you mean, home?

403
00:51:02,921 --> 00:51:04,801
We're both orphans.

404
00:51:07,681 --> 00:51:10,241
You too?
- Me too.

405
00:51:11,481 --> 00:51:15,881
I was abandoned by my parents
when I was just three years old.

406
00:51:17,041 --> 00:51:20,761
Children are so lovely
when they are three years of age.

407
00:51:21,881 --> 00:51:25,841
How can anyone abandon
a three year old?

408
00:51:26,001 --> 00:51:27,841
Where do you find the nerve?

409
00:51:29,641 --> 00:51:31,841
I never knew you were an orphan, too.

410
00:51:32,001 --> 00:51:34,761
Well... now you know.

411
00:51:36,961 --> 00:51:39,681
Does Lenny know?
- No.

412
00:51:39,841 --> 00:51:41,921
And he never will.

413
00:51:42,081 --> 00:51:43,641
Why not?

414
00:51:45,401 --> 00:51:47,641
Because...

415
00:51:47,801 --> 00:51:50,441
you don't steal
the stage from the Pope.

416
00:51:51,561 --> 00:51:56,001
And you don't interfere
with his sorrow.
